# Contributing to IntervueX

We love your input! We want to make contributing to IntervueX as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Getting Started

We have templates set up to help you get started quickly:

### Issue Templates
- **Bug Report**: Use this template when reporting bugs
- **Feature Request**: Use this template when proposing new features

### Pull Request Template
We provide a standard PR template that helps you:
- Describe your changes
- Link related issues
- Confirm testing
- List any breaking changes
- Request specific reviewers

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface
2. Update the documentation with details of any new features
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of two other developers

## Any Contributions You Make Will Be Under the Apache License 2.0
When you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [Apache License 2.0](LICENSE.md) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report Bugs Using GitHub's [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/yourusername/hackbyte-ai-mentor/issues)

## Write Bug Reports With Detail, Background, and Sample Code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* You can try running `npm run lint` for style unification
